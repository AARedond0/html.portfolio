<h1>Alex's best movies of all time</h1>
<h2>My top three favorites</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Troy</h3>

<p>Starring: Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, and Orlando Bloom.<br /> 
An all star casts, retelling the story of The Iliad.<br />
An epic battle of massive proportion, spectacular<br /> 
cinematography, and a stunning show of a sturdy,<br /> 
muscular physique of Brad as the Greek warrior Achilles.<p>

<h3>A Winter's Tale</h3>
<img src="../assets/images/winter's tale.png" height="300"></img>
<p>Starring: Collin Farell, Jessica Findlay, Russel Crowe,<br /> William Hurt, and Jennifer Connelly.<br /> 
A story of miracle. You or me, a miracle to someone.<br /> A story of undying love, 
an everlasting love. A battle between good<br /> and evil, where good always prevails.</p>

<h3>An Interview with God</h3>
<img src="../assets/images/interview with God.png" height="300"></img>
<p>Starring: Brenton Thwaites, and David Strathairn.<br />
This movie attempts to present God as all powerful and everloving God.<br /> 
How He works in mysterious ways, and that His will and human<br />
free will are not contradictory because they are not<br /> two version of the same 
thing, but rather, they fit together perfectly.<br /> It addresses one of the most common question<br /> both believers and 
non believers ask;<br /> 'why do bad things happen to good people?'<br /> This movie is well written and I highly recommend 
to anyone.</p>
